# Hi, I'm Daniel Kantor. 👋

## About Me
I was born in Miami, FL and raised in Brooklyn, NY. I enlisted in the US Army as a 19D (Cavalry Scout) at the age of 19 and did just shy of 5 years. I was stationed in Germany for 4 years and have traveled to many European countries. I am now attending college working towards my Masters to become a Software Engineer in today's society. I look forward/am open to working in Defense Contracting, Web Development and just about anything I can find enjoyment out of with coding/debugging.

## My Foo 🎯
I am interested in exploring the world, coding and playing video games. I look forward to learning as many languages that I desire to learn and to build projects I am proud of.

## Currently Learning
- 🤖 C++, Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- 🐙 GitHub Workflows, coding standards and how to be an entry level software developer/engineer.
- 💡 How to build a variety of projects from games to web design to strengthen my developer skills.

## Fun Fact
I have been to 9 European countries and 2 African countries before the age of 22. I have traveled more than most Americans will in their lifetime!
